# AlgoDerivatives.

## AlgoDerivatives is a decentralized options and futures marketplace built on and powered by Algorand.

This organization contains AlgoDerivatives repositories and projects.

AlgoDerivatives MVP is getting built based on AVM and TEAL version 7 . CLOBs as main operational unit of AlgoDerivatives are built and operate using Algorand Smart Contracts C2C and ABI features. CLOB vaults use both Application and Logic Sig modes of Algorand ASCs.
There is no central order book and every instrument is a collection of smart contracts interacting with user wallet in a decentralized and trustless way.
